## About Me
I am a problem solver and quick thinker, passionate about Machine Learning and Data Science. I specialize in Computer Vision and Financial Risk/Data Analysis, where I am an experienced and proven professional.

Taking initiative, leading teams, and communicating effectively are some of my greatest strengths, which I have honed through my diverse professional experiences. I have over 6 years of experience in Python, using technologies such as PyTorch, Keras, Pandas, and Selenium. My skills in JavaScript, HTML, and SQL, as well as my extensive knowledge of AWS services like EC2, S3, K8S, Lambda, and RDS make me a strong project architect and technical leader.

## Projects
Playing board games is one of my favourite hobbies, and in my profile you will see several technical analyses of popular board games. If you have any feedback on these projects, or just want to talk strategy, feel free to send me a message!

Sports, Financial Forecasting, and Computer Vision are some of my other interests.
